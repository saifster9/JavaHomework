a Boolean variable indicating whether or not the student is an IT major, and a character gender.
The default value for name is an empty string, for age is 0, for the Boolean variable is false, 
and for the gender is ‘\u0000’.
To compute the student’s age, the year of birth and the current year must be provided.
The student’s name and gender are set to the values provided.
To set the Boolean value, the student’s major must be provided. If it is “IT”, the Boolean variable is set to true;
